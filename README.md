MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Using Neural Networks
Description: This project implements a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the popular MNIST dataset. The goal is to accurately recognize digits (0-9) written in various styles. The dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images, each 28x28 grayscale image.

Key Features:

Model Architecture: A fully connected neural network was used to train on the MNIST dataset. The model consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers with activation functions, and an output layer for classification.
Optimization: Adam optimizer was used along with categorical cross-entropy as the loss function.
Accuracy: The model achieved an impressive 97-98% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen data.
Frameworks Used: TensorFlow/Keras (or any other framework you used).
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and evaluate performance.
The model can be further tuned or used as a base for experimenting with other datasets.
Future Improvements:

Experimenting with different architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance further.
Dataset: The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark dataset for digit classification and can be downloaded directly via TensorFlow/Keras or from the official MNIST website.
